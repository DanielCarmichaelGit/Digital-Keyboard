# Digital-Keyboard

The digital keyboard was created to test my abilities in creating a beautifully designed experience as well as to test my knowledge of flex displays. 

How to use:
click on each key to input the key value into the input box at the top of the screem
the keyboard can also be dragged around which has no real purpose except to add depth to the design
